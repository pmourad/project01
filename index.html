        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I like to consider myself as an artist. Even though I majored in Multimedia Graphic Design, I also am a musician. I've recorded two independent albums in which I play the drums, guitar and keyboard. I also enjoy singing, but it's not my best quality! Just ask the shower! I also enjoy theatre, drawing and just being somewhat of a dreamer. Now I'm taking the TeamTreeHouse Techdegree because as a graphic designer I want to find a better job. I would also like to take some 3D and Motion Graphics course, to refresh what I learned a while ago.</p>

        <h2>3D Modeling and Animation</h2>
        <p>I am currently doing a research on schools that offer a 3D modeling and animation degree. Unfortunatly here in Chile, there is no market for this kind of art, and I will be contacting some schools in the US to see if I would have a possibility to study abroad and eventually get a good job abroad as well.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Motion Graphics</h2>
        <p>Together with Front-End Development and 3D Modeling and Animation, having knowledge on Motion Graphics will be a plus for sure. I work with After Effects and Premiere, but I would like to learn other softwares such as Cinema4D. I am looking for online courses, so if you happen to know of one, please contact me at <a href="mailto:paulamouradp@gmail.com">paulamouradp@gmail.com</a> </p>
